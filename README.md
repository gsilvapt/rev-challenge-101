# REV Challenge 101

This is a sample reverse engineering challenge for people getting their feet wet into this. It's only for ethical hacking 
purposes, no ill intended.

To compile the binary, ensure you have the proper tool set available in your machine:
- [Rust must be installed](https://rust-lang.org/)
- C development suite must be installed: `apt install build-essentials` or `dnf group install "C Development Tools and Libraries" "Development Tools"`.

Binaries to download should also be available (soon) through the releases tab.

Any questions or contributions are welcomed - please use the issue tab.
